ANSWER:
According to Schopenhauer, art plays a crucial role in his philosophy, serving as a means to transcend the will and gain pure knowledge (Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, Vol. 1, Chunk 1205). Art is a way to objectify the will, allowing us to contemplate the world without being influenced by our own desires and emotions. This contemplation, in turn, can deliver us from the constant suffering caused by our individual wills.

Schopenhauer argues that art is not just a matter of concept or intellectual understanding (Chunk 1067), but rather it arises directly from life and nature itself. The true artist, with their "pure, true, and deep knowledge" (Chunk 1205), is able to capture this direct apprehension in their work, creating a genuine and immortal piece of art that can evoke feelings of pure knowing in others.

Moreover, Schopenhauer suggests that art has the power to momentarily free us from our individual wills and desires, allowing us to experience the world as it truly is (Chunk 905). This freedom is essential for achieving a state of pure knowledge, where we can contemplate the beauty of nature without being influenced by our own emotions or desires.

In Schopenhauer's view, art is not just a reflection of reality but an actual means to transcend it. Through art, we can momentarily escape the "storm of passion" and enter a realm of pure knowing, where everything is absent that influenced our will (Chunk 905). This experience has a profound impact on us, lifting us out of our individual misery and allowing us to appreciate the beauty of the world in all its forms.

In summary, Schopenhauer sees art as a means to transcend the will, gain pure knowledge, and experience the beauty of the world. Art is not just a matter of concept or intellectual understanding but arises directly from life and nature itself. The true artist, with their "pure, true, and deep knowledge," can capture this direct apprehension in their work, creating genuine and immortal pieces that evoke feelings of pure knowing in others.
