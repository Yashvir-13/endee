ANSWER:
I can answer this question based on the provided context passages.

Schopenhauer believes that suffering is fundamental to life because it arises from the inherent conflict between the will to live and the individual's own self-preservation, which is conditioned by the principle of individuation (Passage 3). This conflict leads to a perpetual struggle for existence, where individuals are forced to assert their own will to live at the expense of others. This leads to suffering for both oneself and others.

Furthermore, Schopenhauer argues that this fundamental suffering is not just a product of knowledge or experience but rather stems from the blind will to live itself (Passage 4). He claims that even if an individual were merely a knowing being, death would be indifferent, but since individuals are also driven by a will to live, they fear death and cling to life out of this illusory inclination to sensual pleasure (Passage 4).

Schopenhauer's notion is supported by the following passages:

* [Source: schopenhauer_World_as_will_and_idea_vol3.txt, Chunk 1250] "The assertion of the will to live, which accordingly has its centre in the act of generation, is in the case of the brute infallible. For the will, which is the _natura naturans_, first arrives at reflection in man."
* [Source: schopenhauer_World_as_will_and_idea_vol1.txt, Chunk 1521] "The working out of this chapter of ethics would contain the precise definition of the limits to which an individual may go in the assertion of the will already objectified in his body without denying the same will as it appears in another individual; and also the actions which transgress these limits, which consequently are wrong."
* [Source: schopenhauer_World_as_will_and_idea_vol3.txt, Chunk 963] "For, by going back to the root, where, by means of self-consciousness, the phenomenon and the thing in itself meet, we have just, as it were, palpably apprehended that the two are absolutely incommensurable, and the whole manner of being of the one, together with all the fundamental laws of its being, signify nothing, and less than nothing, in the other."

In conclusion, Schopenhauer believes suffering is fundamental to life because it arises from the inherent conflict between the will to live and individual self-preservation, which is conditioned by the principle of individuation.
