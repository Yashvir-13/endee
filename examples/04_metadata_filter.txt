ANSWER:
According to Schopenhauer, music expresses the inner nature of the world, which he understands as the will. He argues that music is not just an art form but a direct objectification and copy of the whole will itself, whereas other arts are indirect objectifications through the Ideas (Platonic Forms) (Passage 1). Music speaks directly to the thing itself, unlike other arts that speak only of shadows.

Schopenhauer also emphasizes that music is not just an abstract representation but a concrete expression of emotions and will. He contends that when music expresses the emotions of will that constitute the heart of an event, it becomes expressive (Passage 2).

Furthermore, Schopenhauer suggests that music has a deeper significance connected to the inmost nature of the world and our own self. He views music as a copy or representation of the original, which is the world itself. This relation between music and the world is deep, true, and accurate, but also obscure (Passage 5).

Schopenhauer believes that when one listens to music with constant reflection on his theory concerning it, they will be able to understand the significance of music as a copy of the original, which is the world itself.

In summary, Schopenhauer views music as a direct and powerful expression of the will, which speaks to the thing itself, unlike other arts that speak only of shadows. He also emphasizes the deeper significance of music connected to the inmost nature of the world and our own self, and suggests that it is a copy or representation of the original, which is the world itself.
